# Newbie WebDev Bible

 A mock up for the website will be inserted here using ami.responsivedesign.is
 
 A guide for newbie developers
 

# UX

## Goals

### Visitor Goals

The central target audience for the Newbie WebDev bible are:
- Anyone who has just started creating projects or working as a developer that needs some quick references and guidance to get
the job done.

User goals are:
- Quickly reference and remember how to do simple tasks that could be easy to forget when starting out

The Newbie WebDev bible is a great way to meet these needs because:
- All the information is collated into one area without having to have multiple tabs and google searces open

### Creators Goals

The Goals of the creator are:
- Make life easier for the new developer who is feeling pressured to perfom in a new work environment.

## User Stories

As a visitor to The Newbie WebDevs Bible website I expect/want/need:

1. To easily remember important html and css references and get guidance

1. To remember how to ust git & GitHub

## Wireframes

These wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) during the Scope Plane 
part of the design and planning process for this project.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
